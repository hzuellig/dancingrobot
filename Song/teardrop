[Verse 1]
Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Feathers on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Feathers on my breath

[Chorus]
Teardrop on the fire
Feathers on my breath

[Verse 2]
Night, night of matter
Black flowers blossom
Feathers on my breath
Black flowers blossom
Feathers on my breath

[Chorus]
Teardrop on the fire
Feathers on my...

[Verse 3]
Water is my eye
Most faithful mirror
Feathers on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Of a confession
Feathers on my breath
Most faithful mirror
Feathers on my breath

[Chorus]
Teardrop on the fire
Feathers on my breath

[Outro]
You're stumbling in the dark
You're stumbling in the dark
